GET /
- Hello world

GET /servers
- Returns a list of servers
- Response contains two fields, a "message" field containing a string and a "data" field containing an array.
- Each member of the "data" field array contains the following fields:
 - "dc": A string containing the data centre the server is located in
 - "id": A string containing the unique ID of the server
 - "online": A number containing the UTC time at which the server was first onlined
 - "status":
  - "GREEN" if the server is functioning normally
  - "YELLOW" if the server is experiencing minor problems
  - "ORANGE" if the server is experiencing significant problems
  - "RED" if the server is experiencing critical problems
  - "GREY" if the server is offline

Example response:
```
{
  "message": "OK",
  "data": [
    {
      "dc":"NA",

GET /impressions
- Return impressions and spend details for a data centre
- Parameters:
 - dc:   required, two upper case characters
 from: optional, number corresponding to the Javascript date from which to retrive data
 - to:   optional, number corresponding to the Javascript date up to which to retrieve data
- Response contains two fields, a "message" field containing a string and a "data" field containing an array.
 - The "data" field array contains server performance measurements over 10-minute time slices.
- Each member of the "data" field array contains the following fields:
 - timestamp:   the UTC time when the 10-minute measurement slice ended
 - platform:    what type of device/application the ad was served to (can be "desktop", "mobile" or "app")
 - format:      what type of ad was served (can be "video" or "banner")
 - impressions: the number of impressions served in the timeslice
 - spend:       the total cpm spend on this platform and format during the timeslice

Example response:
```

GET /performance
- Return performance details for a data centre and or/server
- Parameters
 - dc:     required, two upper case characters
 - server: required, two upper case characters followed by four digits, or "ALL" for an aggregate for all servers in a data centre
 - from:   optional, number corresponding to the Javascript date from which to retrive data
 - to:     optional, number corresponding to the Javascript date up to which to retrieve data
- Response contains two fields, a "message" field containing a string and a "data" field containing an array.
 - The "data" field array contains server performance measurements over 10-minute time slices.
- Each member of the "data" field array contains the following fields:
 - timestamp: the UTC time when the 10-minute measurement slice ended
 - requests: the number of requests serviced by the server in this 10-minute period
 - timing: an array with four members containing performance buckets for server responses: 
  - number of responses that took under 0.01s to serve,
  - number of responses that took under 0.01-0.1s to serve,
  - number of responses that took under 0.1-1s to serve,
  - number of responses that took 1s or more to serve
 - mean: a number containing the mean response time for all requests in this time period
 - lag: delay in milliseconds between the time slice ending and performance data arriving at the monitoring server
 - warns: number of warning messages generated by the server during the time slice

Example response:
```
{
  "message": "OK",
  "data": [
    {
      "timestamp":1477639800000,
